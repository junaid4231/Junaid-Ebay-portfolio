## Animation Strategy

**Strategic Animations (Framer Motion):**
- Hero elements: Staggered fade-in on load (0.2s delays)
- Cards: Fade-in + slide-up on scroll into view
- Numbers/Metrics: Count-up animation when visible
- 3D elements: Continuous subtle rotation and float
- Cursor trail: Custom cursor with gradient trail effect
- Hover states: Scale and glow transitions (0.3s ease)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Limit particle count to 50-100 for mobile
- Reduce motion for users with prefers-reduced-motion
- Lazy load Three.js scene on hero visibility

## Accessibility

- Focus indicators with cyan glow matching theme
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Form validation with clear error states
- Sufficient contrast ratios (test against dark backgrounds)
- Alt text for all portfolio images with descriptive context

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (single column, simplified 3D)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (2-column grids)
- Desktop: > 1024px (full multi-column layouts)
- Large: > 1280px (max-w-7xl containers)
